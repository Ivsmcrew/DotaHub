## DotaHub

"DotaHub" is a single page application, servise, built on the basis of the OPENDOTA API. React.js was selecetes as a framework.
Was using such libraries as React Transition Group, React Router, React Icons.

This project is the first one in which I used ReactJs. It gave me experience at the following points: 

- Structuring of a project, separating a code into components with theirs own logic
- Main React hooks: useState, useEffet, useRef, useContext, useMemo, useCallback
- Main React libraries noticed above
- Handling with data from API(fetch, SQL queries)
- Drawing plots with CANVAS API
- Deploying of a frontend app(setting up of nginx, domain, https, docker)

The project is an introductory nature, so it was advisable not to end it. Working tabs are main page, heroes page and page of specific hero.
